# barbados-pipes

An interactive shiny interface to visualize the risk of pipe bursts around the island of Barbados.

This is an ongoing project, which implements a fuzzy model for burst risk accounting for several environmental factors. The model was developed during Dr. Tara Mackey's PhD research. The dashboard only shows the risk calculations resulting from the model, considering several climate change precipitation scenarios.

The user can filter pipes based on soil types, location and pipe characteristics. The UI remains in an early-stage, and will continue to be developed.
